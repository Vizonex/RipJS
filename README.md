# RipJS
A Ast Parser built and inspired by meryiah for the purpose of webscraping by traversing an AST and rewriting it.

## Why?
Currently I seem to have a special intrest in the yt-dlp-ejs project and I felt like this concept of 
ripping out and rebuilding ECMA Scripts could be utilized elsewhere and be less costly to construct these
ASTs in languages like python. 

## Why Rust?
C is a little bit more time consuming than I had originally wished for and I wanted to try keeping as much
of the script 1 to 1 with meryiah's AST as much as possible.
